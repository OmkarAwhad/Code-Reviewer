❌ Bad Code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction(){return a+b;}\n```\n\n🔍 Issues:\n\n*   ❌ The function lacks a name, making it an anonymous function without assignment or usage context.\n*   ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, implying they are free variables which can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n```javascript\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n💡 Improvements:\n\n*   ✔ The function is named `add`, which improves readability and allows it to be called by name.\n*   ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, defining them within the function scope and eliminating reliance on external variables.\n*   ✔ Includes appropriate white space to improve readability.\n
